                        <p>Hi there! I'm Mark, a game developer who loves bringing ideas to life through code and creativity. My journey with Unity began back in 2018 when I built my first simple platformer — watching it come to life on screen totally hooked me </p>
                        <br />
                        <p> Since then, I’ve worked on a variety of projects, from fast-paced action games to narrative-driven experiences, learning tons along the way. These days, I’m passionate about crafting immersive, fun, and meaningful games with engaging mechanics, rich worlds, and innovative blockchain integration that empowers players and redefines digital ownership.</p>
